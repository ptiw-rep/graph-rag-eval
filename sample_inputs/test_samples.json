    "source": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving. AI can be categorized into weak AI and strong AI. Weak AI is designed to perform narrow tasks, like facial recognition or internet searches. Strong AI, on the other hand, refers to systems that can handle any intellectual task that a human being can. AI has applications in many industries, including healthcare, finance, education, and transportation. Machine learning is a subset of AI that allows machines to improve at tasks through experience. Deep learning, a further subset of machine learning, uses neural networks to model and understand complex patterns in data. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is another branch of AI that enables machines to understand and respond to human language. AI ethics is a growing field that addresses concerns about bias, transparency, and the societal impact of AI systems.",
